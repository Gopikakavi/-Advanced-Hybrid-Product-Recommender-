Advanced Hybrid Product Recommender (with Streamlit UI)

üöÄ Overview

The Advanced Hybrid Product Recommender (with Streamlit UI) is a full-stack application designed to deliver highly relevant product recommendations. It leverages a sophisticated hybrid AI approach in the backend, combining multiple cutting-edge and traditional recommendation techniques, and presents them through an intuitive Streamlit frontend. This provides a robust and intelligent recommendation experience.

This system is built with:

FastAPI for a high-performance, asynchronous backend API.

Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive frontend user interface.

Various AI models for diverse recommendation strategies.

‚ú® Features

Hybrid Recommendation Logic: Combines scores from multiple models for comprehensive and accurate suggestions.

TF-IDF: Content-based recommendations based on product descriptions.

BERT Embeddings: Advanced content-based recommendations using deep learning for semantic similarity.

Popularity-Based: Recommends trending and highly-rated products.

Collaborative Filtering (Item-Similarity): Recommends products based on user ratings and preferences, finding similar items.

Sentiment Analysis: Incorporates product review sentiment to boost positively reviewed items and penalize negatively reviewed ones.

Scalable Backend: Built with FastAPI, ready for production-grade deployment.

Interactive Streamlit Frontend: A user-friendly interface for exploring recommendations, applying user/product context, and even adjusting model weights.

Modular Design: Easily integrate or swap out recommendation models.

CORS Enabled: Seamless integration between frontend and backend.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
Bash
git clone https://github.com/Gopikakavi/-Advanced-Hybrid-Product-Recommender-.git
cd -Advanced-Hybrid-Product-Recommender


2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Bash
python -m venv venv

3. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:
Bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
Bash
     source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Prepare Data

Ensure you have your data files (products.json, ratings.json, reviews.json) in the data/ directory. Dummy data files are included for initial setup. You can replace these with your own datasets.

üöÄ Running the Application
This project consists of two main parts: the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend. Both need to be running simultaneously.

1. Start the FastAPI Backend

     Open your first terminal, activate the virtual environment, navigate to the project root, and run:

Bash

      (venv) C:\path\to\your\project> uvicorn api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
You should see output indicating that Uvicorn is running, typically on http://0.0.0.0:8000. You can access the API documentation (Swagger UI) at http://localhost:8000/docs.

2. Start the Streamlit Frontend
       Open a second terminal, activate the same virtual environment, navigate to the project root, and run:
Bash
     (venv) C:\path\to\your\project> streamlit run app.py

This will open the Streamlit application in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

üìä Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are running:

Interact with the Streamlit App:

            Use the sidebar to input a User ID or select a Product.
            Adjust the Number of Recommendations.
            (Optional) Enable Custom Weights to fine-tune the influence of each recommendation model (TF-IDF, BERT, Collaborative, Popularity, Sentiment).
             Click "Get Recommendations" to see the results.

Test the FastAPI API Directly (Optional):

                Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/docs to access the interactive API documentation.

You can directly test the /recommend endpoint by providing a JSON request body.


üìù Extending and Customizing

Adding New Models: Create a new Python file in the models/ directory (e.g., new_model.py), implement a get_recommendations method, and then integrate it into hybrid_model.py and update the weights in api/main.py and app.py.

Data Updates: Replace the products.json, ratings.json, and reviews.json files with your own datasets. Ensure their structure matches the expected format.

Model Tuning: Experiment with different weights in hybrid_model.py or directly through the Streamlit UI to find the optimal combination for your data.

Deployment: For production, consider containerizing your FastAPI application with Docker and deploying it to cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
